For the following exercises, make a single pdf with screenshots showing the
installation commands, the execution commands, and some of the output.
For each part, explain what the code or output means.

Process fastq files:

1) Use fastp to process paired-end reads.
Check out the readme for installation and running instructions.

https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp#get-fastp

The paired-end fastq file. The R indicates direction. R1 is Forward, R2 is Reverse.
Here is the reverse read (the R1 was corrupted). The QIIME2 website has more of these files.
They can also be downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive and NCBI:

insub732_2_R2.fastp.fastq.gz

2) Use Kaiju to analyze a metagenomic dataset with viruses.

Try installing the program or, in desperation, you can use the web server.
http://kaiju.binf.ku.dk/

Use the viruses database.
Installation and usage instructions:
https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/kaiju/blob/master/README.md

Test files:
reads_1.fq
reads_2.fq

3) If you want to extend yourself, try a genome assembly. 

Use the SPAdes (St. Petersburg genome assembler) to assemble a virus genome.
Installation instructions:
http://cab.spbu.ru/files/release3.14.0/manual.html#sec1

The file to assemble:
SP1.fq
