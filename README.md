# Overview
Part 1: This R Notebook performs a full RNA-seq differential expression analysis using public GEO data (GSE63310) from mammary epithelial cell subtypes. The workflow follows the limma-voom pipeline and includes data preprocessing, quality control, normalization, visualization, statistical modeling, and gene set enrichment analysis.

Part 2: This notebook performs differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2, focusing on comparing treated (TCPMOH) versus control (DMSO) samples. It includes sample metadata preparation, DESeq2 processing, result interpretation, and rich visualizationsâ€”especially multiple styles of volcano plots.

Part 3: This notebook performs single-cell RNA-seq analysis on PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) data using the Seurat R package. It covers the complete workflow from data loading and quality control to dimensionality reduction, clustering, marker identification, and cell type annotation. The goal is to identify distinct immune cell populations based on gene expression profiles.
